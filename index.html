				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<p>
				Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer who is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world. He was born on 
				November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India. Kohli is known for his aggressive and dynamic style of play, exceptional batting 
				skills, and strong leadership qualities.	
			</p>
			<p>
				Kohli made his international debut in August 2008, representing the Indian cricket team in a One Day International (ODI)
			   match against Sri Lanka. He quickly established himself as a prolific run-scorer and rose through the ranks to become the
			    captain of the Indian cricket team across all formats.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Tests, Kohli has been a consistent performer, accumulating numerous centuries and leading the Indian team to
				 significant victories both at home and abroad. He has also excelled in limited-overs cricket, particularly in ODIs,
				  where he has achieved remarkable records. Kohli has scored multiple centuries and has played a crucial role in India's 
				  triumph in major tournaments like the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013 and the Asia Cup in 2018.
			</p>
			<p>
				During his career, Kohli has received numerous accolades, including several ICC awards such as the Sir Garfield Sobers 
				Trophy for ICC Cricketer of the Year and the ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year. He has also been recognized as one of the 
				Wisden Cricketers of the Year.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2021, Kohli stepped down as the captain of the Indian cricket team in the shortest format of the game (T20Is) but 
				continued to lead the team in Test matches and ODIs until my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. However, please note that 
				since my knowledge is not up to date, I may not be aware of any recent developments regarding Kohli's captaincy or his 
				current performance on the field.
